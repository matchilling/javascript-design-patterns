A curated collection of idiomatic design & application patterns for JavaScript programming language.

## Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

|                  Pattern                  | Description                                     |
| :---------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------- |
| [Constructor](/creational/constructor.md) | Create multiple instances of the same object    |
|   [Singleton](/creational/singleton.md)   | Restricts instantiation of a type to one object |
